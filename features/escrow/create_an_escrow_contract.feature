Feature: Create an escrow contract
  As Alice,
  I want to create an escrow contract between different participants,
  so that there is no need to trust in each other.

  Background:
    Given the maximum number of participants per escrow contract is 15
    And the maximum number of transactions per escrow contract is 1000
    And an escrow contract requires to lock at least 10 "xem" to guarantee that the it will conclude
    And an escrow contract is active up to 2 days
    And the mean block generation time is 15 seconds
    And Alice has at least 10 xem in her account

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract
    Given Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | sender | recipient | type          | data             |
      | Alice  | Bob       | send-an-asset | 1 concert.ticket |
      | Bob    | Alice     | send-an-asset | 20 euros         |
    And "Alice" locked 10 "xem" to guarantee that the contract will conclude in less than 2 days
    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract adding a new participant
    Given Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | sender   | recipient | type          | data             |
      | Alice    | Bob       | send-an-asset | 1 concert.ticket |
      | Bob      | Exchange  | send-an-asset | 20 xem           |
      | Exchange | Alice     | send-an-asset | 20 euros         |
    And "Alice" locked 10 "xem" to guarantee that the contract will conclude in less than 2 days
    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract signed by all the participants
    Given Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | sender | recipient | type          | data             |
      | Alice  | Bob       | send-an-asset | 1 concert.ticket |
      | Bob    | Alice     | send-an-asset | 20 euros         |
    And every sender accepts the contract
    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a confirmation notification
    And the swap of assets should conclude

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract using other types of transactions
    Given Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | sender | type                             | data                      |
      | Alice  | register-a-namespace             | alice                     |
      | Bob    | create-a-multisignature-contract | 1-of-1, cosignatory:alice |
    And "Alice" locked 10 "xem" to guarantee that the contract will conclude in less than 2 days
    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract and another account locks the funds for that contract
    Given Alice defined a valid escrow contract
    And "Bob" locked 10 "xem" to guarantee that the contract will conclude in less than 2 days
    When she publishes the contract

    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account tries to create an escrow contract with too many transactions
    Given Alice defined an escrow contract involving more than 1000 transactions

    Then "Alice" should see every sender participant received confirmation notification
    And She should see swap of assets have concluded

And she locked 10 "xem" to guarantee that the contract will conclude in less than 2 days
And she published the contract
When "Alice" wants to see if every sender participant received the notifications from the contract signed with other types of transactions
