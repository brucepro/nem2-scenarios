Feature: Register an asset
  As Alice
  I want to register an asset
  So that I can send one unit to Bob.

  Background:
    Given registering an expiring asset costs 50 xem
    And the mean block generation time is 15 seconds
    And the maximum registration period is 1 year
    And the maximum asset divisibility is 6
    And the maximum number of assets an account can have is 1000
    And the maximum asset supply is 9000000000
    And Alice has 10000000 xem in her account

  Scenario Outline: An account registers an expiring asset
    When Alice registers an asset for <seconds> seconds
    Then she should receive a confirmation message
    And she should become the owner of the new asset
    And it should be registered for at least <seconds> seconds
    And her xem balance should decrease in 50 units

    Examples:
      |seconds|
      | 15    |
      | 20    |
      | 30    |

  Scenario: An account registers a non-expiring asset
    When Alice registers a non-expiring asset
    Then she should receive a confirmation message
    And she should become the owner of the non-expiring asset
    And her xem balance should decrease in 50 xem

  Scenario Outline: An account tries to register an asset for an invalid duration
    When Alice registers an asset for <seconds> seconds
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Mosaic_Invalid_Duration"
    And her xem balance should remain intact

    Examples:
      | seconds    |
      | 0          |
      | -1         |
      | 1          |
      | 40000000000|

  Scenario: An account tries to register an asset but already owns 999 different assets
    Given Alice is the owner of 999 assets
    When Alice registers an asset for 1 day
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Mosaic_Max_Mosaics_Exceeded"
    And her xem balance should remain intact

  Scenario Outline: An account registers an asset with a valid property
    When Alice registers a "<property>" asset for 1 day
    Then she should receive a confirmation message
    And she should become the owner of the new asset
    And it should have the property "<property>"

    Examples:
      | property         |
      | transferable     |
      | non-transferable |
      | supply mutable   |
      | supply immutable |
      | levy mutable     |
      | levy immutable   |

  Scenario Outline: An account tries to register an asset with a valid divisibility
    When Alice registers an asset with divisibility <divisibility> for 1 day
    Then she should receive a confirmation message
    And she should become the owner of the new asset
    And the asset should handle up to <divisibility> decimals

    Examples:
      | divisibility |
      | 0            |
      | 6            |

  Scenario Outline: An account tries to register an asset with an invalid divisibility
    When Alice registers an asset with divisibility <number> for 1 day
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Mosaic_Invalid_Divisibility"
    And her xem balance should remain intact

    Examples:
      | number |
      | -1     |
      | 7      |

  Scenario: An account tries to register an asset but does not have enough funds
    Given Alice has spent all her xem
    When Alice registers an asset for 1 day
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Core_Insufficient_Balance"

  Scenario: An account tries to register an asset but has not allowed sending "MOSAIC_DEFINITION" transactions
    Given Alice only allowed sending "TRANSFER" transactions
    When Alice registers an asset for 2 seconds
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Property_Transaction_Type_Not_Allowed"

  Scenario: An account tries to register an asset but has blocked sending "MOSAIC_DEFINITION" transactions
    Given Alice blocked sending "MOSAIC_DEFINITION" transactions
    When Alice registers an asset for 2 seconds
    Then she should receive the error "Failure_Property_Transaction_Type_Not_Allowed"
